# Development Workflow

1. Start the Django development server:

```
cd backend
python manage.py runserver
```

2. Start the Angular development server:

```
cd frontend
ng serve
```

3. Django will serve your API at http://localhost:8000 and Angular will serve your frontend at http://localhost:4200
