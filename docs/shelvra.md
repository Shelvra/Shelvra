## Claude Prompt:

You are a world-leading web developer expert. Can you give me a step by step instructions to set up a social media website for book readers?

The front end should use angular and the back end should use django.

The codes are hosted on a github repository and the website is deployed with google cloud.

The website should include these functionalities:

1. Each user has their personal library where they keep track of the books they read and they can add more book into the library as they read them and a to-read list.

2. The users can follow each other library in an instagram-liked manner, once they follow each other they can see the other personâ€™s library.

3. Each users is allowed to start a thread tagged to a book in a reddit/twitter like manners, where they can review the book or discuss it with other users.

4. There should be a analytics dashboard page where the reading statistics over time of the reader is analyzed and presented to the user to track their reading journey over time.

5. As users read book, they receive award badges for milestones (e.g., number of books read, participation in discussions) to encourage active engagement.

6. The users can also highlight favorite passages or notes that can be shared within discussion threads.
